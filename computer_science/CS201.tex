\subsection{What is Computer Science?}

\bigbreak

Computer science is the study of \textbf{algorithms}.\\\\
An \textbf{algorithm} is an effective method for solving a problem, expressed as a finite sequence of steps.\\\\
The development of algorithms works in this recurring order:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Design}
	\item \textbf{Analysis}
	\item \textbf{Implement}
	\item \textbf{Experiment}\smallskip
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the \textbf{design} phase, we design an algorithm using pseudo-code. In the \textbf{analysis} phase, we need to analyze the correctness and the efficiency. That is to say, we make sure that our algorithm will work and completes in a reasonable amount of time. During the \textbf{implementation}, the algorithm is written in code on a computer. Finally, the algorithm is run and debugged in the \textbf{experiment} phase. This process repeats.
